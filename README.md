# Experimental Analysis of Rumour Systems

## Analysis

Code used to organize and quantify the results of any experiments.

Mock data from Mockaroo: [scheme](https://www.mockaroo.com/schemas/294135)

Pregistration done with: [aspredicted.org](https://aspredicted.org/)

## Hypotheses

### System level hypotheses

The presence of credibility indicators in the system will:

- $H_1$: *decrease* the *affirmation rate* for rumours with lower evidence levels.
- $H_2$: *increase* the *denial rate* for rumours with lower evidence levels.
- $H_3$: *increase* the *affirmation rate* for rumours with higher evidence levels.
- $H_4$: *decrease* the *denial rate* for rumours with higher evidence levels.

### Post level hypotheses

- $H_5$: No credibility indicator will moderate the effect of evidence in resharing
- $H_6$: The effect of credibility indicators will be impacted by post meta-data, such as the poster's gender and the temporal proximity of the information.
