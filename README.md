# Experimental Analysis of Rumour Systems

## Analysis

Code used to organize and quantify the results of any experiments.

Mock data from Mockaroo: [scheme](https://www.mockaroo.com/schemas/294135)

Pregistration can be seen on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/6ug4m/) (OSF).

## Hypotheses

### Confirmatory hypotheses

The presence of credibility indicators in the system will:

- **H1**: *decrease* the *affirmation rate* for rumours with lower evidence levels.
- **H2**: *increase* the *denial rate* for rumours with lower evidence levels.
- **H3**: *increase* the *affirmation rate* for rumours with higher evidence levels.
- **H4**: *decrease* the *denial rate* for rumours with higher evidence levels.

### Exploratory Research Questions

- **RQ1**: How does the post-source affect sharing behaviour during protest demonstrations?
- **RQ2**: How does the temporal proximity of online content affect sharing behaviour during protest demonstrations?
- **RQ3**: Is there any evidence of an implied truth effect, whereby attaching credibility indicators to a subset of false posts is considered to imply truthfulness in the posts without a credibility indicator.
