I also affirm rumour 2.

A common problem in ML, natural language processing (NLP), and AI at large surrounds representing objects in a way computers can process. And since computers understand numbers —  which we have a common language for comparing, combining and manipulating — this generally means assigning objects numbers in some fashion. Think taking something abstract but intuitive to humans, like the text of a book, and assigning each word in that book a unique number. That book could then be represented by the list, or vector, of numbers assigned to it. This is the process *of embedding that book as a vector —* and there is an increasingly rich literature of techniques for embedding objects as vectors.
