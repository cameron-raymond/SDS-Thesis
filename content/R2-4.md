I also deny rumour 2.

Before undertaking this project, we had several ideas of what problem to undertake, including solving games such as Snake or Space Invaders. However, many traditional games have already been solved using reinforcement learning methods. While this project takes inspiration from previous studies on using reinforcement learning techniques for traffic light control, the exact nature of the environment (which we have created from scratch) can be easily changed and thus present an entirely new problem. Additionally, although problems such as Snake are interesting, they have no real-world applications other than entertainment. Conversely, traffic light control systems have immense importance in the real-world; poorly designed systems impact commute times and increase carbon emissions due to congestion.
