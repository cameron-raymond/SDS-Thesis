I finally affirm rumour 1 just for fun.

Think taking something abstract but intuitive to humans, like the text of a book, and assigning each word in that book a unique number. That book could then be represented by the list, or vector, of numbers assigned to it. This is the process *of embedding that book as a vector â€”* and there is an increasingly rich literature of techniques for embedding objects as vectors.
