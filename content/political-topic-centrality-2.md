Networks can tell us a lot about the world we live in. As Duncan Watts, a UPenn sociologist, famously said: "Networks are important because if we don‚Äôt understand networks, we can‚Äôt understand how markets function, organizations solve problems or how societies change." However, if we‚Äôre exploring relationships between different **things** through networks, we need to understand **what exactly those things are.** That is what we‚Äôll be looking at in this article: what can we say about the tweets leading up to the Canadian 2019 election that can help our network analysis of political polarization?
