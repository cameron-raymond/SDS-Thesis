The above network, I believe, is telling when it comes to our current political climate. Less and less are our politicians willing to work across the aisle in order to pass bi- or multi-partisan legislature. While this network from The Economist uses American Senate votes to illustrate this phenomena, partisanship is on the rise globally and is not only found in “formal politics”. Over the past 40 years, people have become less willing to be friends¹, work with², or marry³ someone with different political beliefs. This is a term referred to as homophily, and in a word means that “birds of a feather flock together.” Why is this a problem? Often political beliefs act as borders, fencing people of different classes, religions, and ethnicities in — so in the interest of a more connected, tolerant society, understanding political partisanship is huge⁴. In this 3 part series, I will argue that _by using network science, unsupervised machine learning, and computational social science — we can gain a more nuanced understanding of political polarization, and when and how it occurs._ Specifically, we’ll use engagement graphs and natural language processing to show that certain types of messages are used to rally a political party leader’s supporters, while others span political beliefs.
