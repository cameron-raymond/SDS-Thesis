Alex Pentland, director of MITâ€™s [Connection Science](http://connection.mit.edu/) initiative and former director of the MIT [Media Lab,](https://www.media.mit.edu/) argues that information flows across networks in a way very similar to the flu. Those who werenâ€™t previously sick, but are repeatedly exposed to those who are, become increasingly likely to â€˜catch itâ€™ and go on to spread it to others. The same goes for ideas. As we are exposed to different viewpoints and perspectives, we have a propensity towards â€˜catchingâ€™ them, which influences are friends and family (our little part of the larger network). This can go on in a cascading affect that disperses information across the entire network. **In this article we will look at political polarization as a function of the flow of ideas in a network.** Specifically, we will see that depending on what a tweet is about, it can â€˜spreadâ€™ very differently.
