William Shakespeare is one of our most recognizable and lauded playwrights. With a writing career that spans 36 (easily attributable) plays, an interesting aspect of his work is that these plays can be split up into well defined categories: comedies, tragedies, and histories. Comedies have happy endings and are uplifting, where the main characters overcome some obstacle. Tragedies generally end with the death of a flawed main character. However, **how can we formalize the difference between comedies and tragedies?** This is what we‚Äôll tackle in this article, but we won‚Äôt do it in the way you might expect.
