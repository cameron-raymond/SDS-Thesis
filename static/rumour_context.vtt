00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.500
Use your words.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.800
What are you doing?

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.000

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.700
Use your words.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.900

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.300

NLG.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.400
You just violated their rights.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.800
Kidnapping people.

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:35.700
You just violated their rights.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.000
Thanks for keeping them fucking noooo

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.400
As we begun making arrests,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.400
we have begun analyzing

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.600
the data of who we've arrested

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600
and begun actually doing

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.300
what you would think

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.200
As almost very similar to our COVID.
It's contact tracing.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.300
Who are they associated with?

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.700
Who what platforms are they
advocating for?

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.500
And we have seen things like white
supremacist organizers, who have

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.200
posted things on platforms about
coming to Minnesota.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.800
We are checking to see, do the folks
that we have that we have made

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.000
arrests on and that we have
information.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.500
Are they connected to those
platforms?
